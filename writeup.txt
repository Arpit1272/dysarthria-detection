Dysarthria, a motor speech disorder, often linked to conditions like cerebral palsy (CP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), poses challenges in clear communication. 
Recent deep learning advancements provide an opportunity for automated detection and characterization of dysarthria. 
Leveraging the TORGO database with data from individuals with CP, ALS, and controls, this project provides a Dysarthria Speech Defect Recognition system. 
Dysarthria's symptoms include slurred speech and word pronunciation difficulties. 
It can be caused by conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson's disease. 
Notably, dysarthria affects 8% to 60% of stroke patients, 10% to 65% of traumatic brain injury patients, and approximately 70% to 100% of Parkinson's disease patients. 
Early detection through deep learning algorithms can have a profound impact on individuals' lives, including famous figures like Stephen Hawking and Muhammad Ali.
